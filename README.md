##Brief
A very simple application playing with the Android TextView.
Application will use Android Studio 3 and Kotlin for development.
It is just a training for me to play with Android App with Kotlin.
##Functions
Control the movement of the '*' on the text view with 4 buttons.


##Progress
-The Star can move left and right  
-The star can move up and down  
-Horizontal movement have boundary

##Todo
-Using TextView for this application is not good.Maybe using another module 
to implement is better.

##Notes
-Android Studio 3 is very powerful. It gives many hint to solve the error and 
clean the warning, but sometimes, the hints are annoying.  
-Android Studio 3 is RAM killer...If my computer just have 4GB RAM, then 
the development is a disaster.
